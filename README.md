### Hi there 👋

#### I'm Yu Pan, a final year Ph.D. student at the University of Utah (2021 ~ 2025)
#### I will join CertiK as a Blockchain Security Engineer(2025 ~ 0xFFFF).

Here are some facts about me.

- I am a smart contract <a href="https://www.dota2.com/hero/tinker" target="_blank">Tinker</a>

- I am fortunate enough to work with  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/muzhang82" target="_blank">Prof. Mu Zhang</a> on security research. Additionally, I work closely with <a href="https://yueduan.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Yue Duan</a> in the same field.
- My interests lie in traditional analysis techniques and finding innovative ways to apply them to new domains.
- I have a tendency to fall asleep when dealing with overly theoretical topics.😴
