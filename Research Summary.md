# Research Summary

Smart contracts are autonomous blockchain programs that facilitate secure and decentralized transactions. However, they are prone to security vulnerabilities and logic errors, which can lead to significant financial losses. To address these challenges, my work focuses on designing and implementing automated techniques to enhance the security, clarity, and robustness of smart contracts, emphasizing three critical areas:

1. **Automated Generation of Security-Centric Descriptions for Smart Contract Bytecode:**
     To improve the accessibility and comprehensibility of smart contract security risks, I developed **Tx2TXT**, a system that generates **human-readable** and **security-centric** descriptions directly from smart contract bytecode. Unlike previous approaches that work only on source code and produce general-purpose or overly technical outputs, Tx2TXT focuses on creating descriptions which highlight security-relevant contexts. The system employs static program analysis to extract smart contract functions directly from the bytecode, constructing a **funds transfer graph** that models critical funds flows. It then uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to identify security-relevant condition nodes, which are integrated into the graph. Finally, Tx2TXT converts the funds transfer graph into human-readable descriptions using a natural language template, ensuring the results are readable and comprehensible. To further aid users, the system includes a clear context outlining specific security risks, empowering them to make informed decisions. A user study validated the system, showing that participants could effectively use the descriptions to understand and assess security problems. Evaluated on **890** labeled contracts, Tx2TXT bridges the gap between complex bytecode and user comprehension, significantly improving transparency and trust in smart contracts.


2. **Semantic Safety Vetting of Smart Contracts:**
     To address higher-level logic errors in decentralized applications (DApps) that go beyond traditional low-level security issues like reentrancy or integer overflows, I contributed to the research of **VetSC**, a system focused on detecting semantic safety risks in smart contracts. VetSC bridges the gap between contract logic and user intent by extracting **business model graphs** through program analysis, which represent the intrinsic safety and operational semantics of contracts. Unlike previous tools that focus on low-level vulnerabilities, VetSC integrates textual semantics from DApp user interfaces to derive application-specific safety specifications, such as rules for function usage and restrictions on state changes. These specifications are validated through a program analysis-guided model checking process to detect logic errors, such as expired lottery tickets or double voting. Applied to **34** real-world DApps, VetSC demonstrated its ability to uncover critical safety risks by emphasizing the higher-level semantic understanding of contracts, thereby enabling safer and more reliable blockchain applications.
